# Web-Technology-Projrct
In this project, we have designed and created an Online Shopping Website by which customers will be able to buy various kind of products with home delivery.
There are 3 portal systems for 3 kinds of users.
The Admin: Who will maintain the buying requests of the customers and distribute them among the delivery guys.
The Delivery-Guys: They will accept the order requests and deliver the product according to the given addresses.
The Customers: They will browse the products and choose the products to buying cart and provide shipping information including paying options.
All kinds pf users will be able to enjoy the features of the website only after registering and then logging into the website.
There are several options available for completing the payment step including online banking like Nogod, Bikash, Upay, Rocket etc and also Cash-On-Delivery.
